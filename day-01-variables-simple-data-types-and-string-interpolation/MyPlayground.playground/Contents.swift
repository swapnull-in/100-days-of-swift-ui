//Summary

//We make variables using var and constants using let.
//It's preferable to use constants as often as possible.

//Strings start and end with double quotes, but if you want
//them to run across multiple lines you should use three sets
//of double quotes.

//Integers hold whole numbers, doubles hold fractional numbers,
//and booleans hold true or false

//String interpolation allows you to create strings from
//other variables and constants, placing their values
//inside your string

//Swift uses type inference to assign each variable or constant a
//type, but you can provide explicit type if you want
