### Days 1-12: Introduction to Swift
The first 12 days provide a gentle warm up for your Swift learning. You’ll watch about a selection of one-minute videos every day, and complete short quizzes about each of those videos.

* Day 1 – variables, simple data types, and string interpolation
* Day 2 – arrays, dictionaries, sets, and enums
* Day 3 – operators and conditions
* Day 4 – loops, loops, and more loops
* Day 5 – functions, parameters, and errors
* Day 6 – closures part one
* Day 7 – closures part two
* Day 8 – structs, properties, and methods
* Day 9 – access control, static properties, and laziness
* Day 10 – classes and inheritance
* Day 11 – protocols, extensions, and protocol extensions
* Day 12 – optionals, unwrapping, and typecasting
 

### Days 13-15: Consolidation I
You just learned a lot about Swift in only 12 days, so before we continue it's important you reflect on what you've learned: look for weak spots, re-watch videos, re-take tests, and so on, until you feel comfortable that you have mastered all the Swift language fundamentals covered in days 1-12.

* Day 13 – Swift review, day one
* Day 14 – Swift review, day two

* Day 41 – Milestone: Projects 7-9
 

### Days 42-49: A whole new world
The next three projects we’ll be making are markedly different from the previous 9 – you’ll learn about making grids rather than tables, learn how to make high-performance 2D games using SpriteKit, and, at last, learn how to save user data.

* Day 50 – Milestone: Projects 10-12
* Day 51 – Expanding your horizons
 

### Days 52-59: Images and animation

* Day 59 – Milestone: Projects 13-15
 

### Days 60-65: Maps and bugs
In the next three projects we’ll be edging a little further away from UIKit as we explore MapKit, Apple’s powerful and flexible mapping framework, then we’ll tackle a skill you’re more than ready for: debugging.
